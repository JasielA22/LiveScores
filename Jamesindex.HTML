        <p class="sport-news">Floyd Mayweather collected a routine victory in his exhibition boxing match against
          YouTube star Deji
          Olatunji on Sunday.

          Mayweather, who is considered one of the greatest boxers to ever live, was never threatened, slowly building
          his pace in the eight-round fight.

          He finished the job in the sixth round with an extended flurry, allowing the referee to step in and call it
          off for a TKO victory.

          It is Mayweather's third exhibition since May as he continues to accept fights from non-professional boxers,
          having last fought professionally against Conor McGregor back in 2017, while his last win against a boxer was
          in 2015.

          Speaking in the ring to DAZN after the result, Mayweather pointed to some swelling under his own eye as an
          indication that the crowd got their money's worth.

          "I'm glad that he landed a good shot, this is part of fighting, this is a part of entertainment," he said.
          "These people want to see entertainment, and fun, and that's what we both gave them tonight."

          He finished with some encouraging words to his opponent, saying "you're a hell of a fighter, a hell of a
          competitor, keep up the great work, and keep building"

            Andre Burakovsky was pondering his options as an unrestricted free agent this past summer, he looked at the
          Seattle Kraken and saw a promising opportunity.

          "When I played against Seattle last year, I thought it was a really tough team to play against," Burakovsky
          said. "I thought it was a new team, an upcoming team, and I wanted to be a part of it. I definitely saw the
          potential in the team."

          <!-- Following a challenging inaugural season in 2021-22, the expansion Kraken are reaching the potential
          Burakovsky envisioned and raising expectations in their second season. Seattle is 16-8-3 heading into the
          third game of a testing road trip against the Tampa Bay Lightning at Amalie Arena on Tuesday (7 p.m. ET;
          BSSUN, ROOT-NW, ESPN+, SN NOW) after ending a three-game losing streak with a 5-2 victory at the Florida
          Panthers on Sunday. -->

          Henri Mouyebe slaps green, red and yellow paint on his bald head and big, bare belly before every Cameroon
          soccer game. He's been transforming his hefty frame into a living, moving Cameroon flag for 40 years in
          support of his team.

          He will take his paint, and a huge dollop of hope, to this year's World Cup in Qatar.

          “We are going there as conquerors, as winners, to play seven matches, play until the end of the tournament,”
          Mouyebe said, forecasting Cameroon will go all the way to the World Cup final.

          Eternal optimism.

          Sadly for Mouyebe, it's most likely misguided given Cameroon's recent World Cup record. The Indomitable Lions
          have won only one game at the last five World Cups they've played in and nothing suggests they'll be walking
          out at Lusail Stadium on Dec. 18 to compete for soccer's biggest prize.
