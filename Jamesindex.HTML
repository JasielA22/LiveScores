    <div class="column">Boxing    <section>Floyd Mayweather Jr. stopped YouTube star Deji Olatunji in the sixth round of an exhibition boxing match on Monday in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Mayweather, after playfully throwing punches at Olatunji's body over the first two rounds, began to deliver shots with slightly more power in Round 3. Mayweather played to the crowd as he tapped Olatunji before he decided to end the exhibition in Round 6.
        Mayweather, 45, pressed Olatunji on the ropes and placed a few more punches with a bit more on them while falling far short of even half-power. Still, it appeared to be enough to daze Olatunji. Mayweather continued to throw punches as Olatunji covered up when referee Kenny Bayless halted the contest, which amounted to a light sparring session.
        The exhibition bout was scheduled for eight two-minute rounds and won't affect Mayweather's official boxing record. Olatunji weighed 175.2 pounds and was nearly 21 pounds more than Mayweather at 154.3 pounds.
            
    The event was Mayweather's fifth exhibition since he retired from professional boxing with a victory over Conor McGregor in 2017.
